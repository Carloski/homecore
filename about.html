                    <h3>Intent & Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main purpose of the website is to serve as a Point of contact and 
                        lead capturing instrument for the company. Aside from showcasing the services offered, 
                        it includes call to action elements such as a contact form in the showcase area and 
                        a free newsletter sign up at the bottom of the first page. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Design Choices</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I was thinking about building this site, I knew I wanted to make it clean, 
                        somewhat modern and something I would like to visit. I didn't want anything too busy that could be hard 
                        to navigate. If the information is hard to get to or takes too many clicks to get information, 
                        users tend to leave and not return. I also added some <a href="https://bit.ly/2OPeqq6" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">CSS animations</span></a> in the about page as well as in the navigation and social lins
                        to make it more attractive. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make the code a bit easier to maintain, I used <a href="https://bit.ly/3gcgxzC" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">"em and "rem"</span></a> in most areas instead of pixels. These units are a multiples 
                        of the page's Pixel size. For example, if the HTML pixel sixe is 16px (This is the default size for browsers) 2em or 2rem would be the same as to 32 pixels (16 X 2 = 32).
                        This made th etimes I wanted to test larger or smaller font sizes in different areas. I can cahnge all the font sizes at once, Iinstead of doing it
                        one by one. It's also useful when setting margin and padding on certain elements. To keep the code more uniformed, I used "rem" only for font sizes and "em" on everything else. Here's a link to a page I found that explains it much better than I ever could. 
                        <a href="https://bit.ly/3gcgxzC" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">Em vs. Rem: Comprehensive Guide</span></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also made use of <a href="https://mzl.la/3e7NSsH" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">CSS Variables</span></a>. 
                        If you go throught he code and look at the elements that use "color" or "background-color" you'll see something like "var(--primary)" as it's value. Like em and rem, this allowed me to test one color in different areas by changing it in 
                        one line of code instead of changing the color in every area. Here's a link if you want to read more about <a href="https://mzl.la/3e7NSsH" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">custom properties</span></a>.

                    <p>
                        The Showcase area of the homepage features a fixed images to give a nice scrolling effect. I implemented a 
                        "multiply" effect with a gradient background to darken the image. This allowed for the layer above the image to look brighter 
                        and more readeable. I used a <a href="https://mzl.la/3uOXf7B" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">feature query</span></a> as a back up in case any the page is ebing viewed in a browsersthat doesn't support the "multiply" effect.

                        some of the elements look the way I wanted when viewed in smaller screens.
