                    <p>
                        Explain to your audience the intent and purpose behind this website. 
                        What steps did you take in creating the website that ensured you met your objectives?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main purpose of the website is to serve as a Point of contact and 
                        lead capturing instrument for the company. Aside from showcasing the services offered, 
                        it includes call to action elements such as a contact form in the showcase area and 
                        a free newsletter sign up at the bottom of the first page.

                    <h3>Design Choices</h3>
                    <p>
                        Why did you make the specific design choices that you did? <span> For each of your websiteâ€™s pages, 
                            explain your rationale for the overall design, as well as the individual components (colors, 
                            typography, etc.).</span> Support your choices with evidence of your consideration of the end user. 
                        What did you do to make your website engaging, professional, and easy to use?

                    <p>
                        When I was thinking about building this site, I knew I wanted to make it clean, 
                        somewhat modern and something I would like to visit. I didn't want anything too busy that could be hard 
                        to navigate. If the information is hard to get to or takes too many clicks to get information, 
                        users tend to leave and not return.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Make your navigation easy to understand and easy to find. 
                            Research shows that most users expect website navigation to be vertical and 
                            centered at the top of the page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use an easy-to-read font for blocks of text. Choose a background color and 
                            text color that contrast well (Hint: No red text on a hot pink background).
                        </li>
                        <li>Keep your website light so that it loads quickly.</li>
                        <li>Make the company logo and tag line prominent on the page.</li>
                        <li>Keep styles and colors consistent across the website.</li>
                        <li>
                            Make notes about what to include in the style sheet as you design, 
                            as you want to keep style and function separate. 
                            This is important, not only to comply with web standards, 
                            but to make it easier to change something in the future if you need to.
                        </li>

                        What could you have done differently if you had more time or resources? What sorts of content,
